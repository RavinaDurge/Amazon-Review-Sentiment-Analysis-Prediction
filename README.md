# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Prediction
1. Discussed about "newreviews.csv' dataset, where helpfulness is the fraction of people who found the review useful, denominator is like how many people reviewed and numerator is among those how many found it helpful. consider it like a percentage. Denominator is both people found useful count + people found not so useful count.  2. Imported the important libraries: nltk, CountVectorizer, TfidfVectorizer, WordCloud, Logistic Regression. Random ForestClassifier,accuracy_score, f1_score.  3. Sampled data by taking 20% of it with resetting the index values.  4. Plotted the distribution of ratings across dataset. 5. Calculated the words per review, plottedhistogram for it.  6. Using wordcloud, generated a visualization of words per review. 7. Applied sentiments to the ratings and visualized graph for its values (0,1).  8. Cleaned the text data using regular expression. 9. Removed the stopwords from the cleaned text and prepared a new column reviews_text.  10. Converted reviews_text and sentiment into string. 11. Using sklearn, splitted the data into training and testing dataset. 12. Performed pipelining of CountVectorizer,TfidfVectorizer, TfidfTransformer, MultinomialNB to improve the accuracy of model. 13. Fittted the model with training values of X
